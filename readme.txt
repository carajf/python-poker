Welcome to Texas Hold 'Em Poker, Python style! Simply run main.py to try your hand at a (simplified) game of poker.

NOTE: I created this code with a browser based IDE, called Repl.it, as it wass the most easily accessible for me running a Chromebook at the time. I have never had any issues running the code, and I have tested it on another browser based platform to ensure it works. In theory an IDE is an IDE and so it should just work, but it does mean there is an indentation issue. It hasn’t stopped the script from working as intended, but it’s odd all the same. In case there are  issues, the link for the Repl is here https://repl.it/@carajf/Texas-Hold-Em.
