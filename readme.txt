NOTE: I created this code with a browser based IDE, called Repl.it, as it is the most easily accessible for me running a Chromebook. I have never had any issues running the code, and I have tested it on another browser based platform to ensure it works. In theory an IDE is an IDE and so it should just work, but as I discuss in the report I have run into an indentation issue. It hasn’t stopped the script from working as intended, but it’s odd all the same. In case there are  issues, the link for the Repl is here https://repl.it/@carajf/Texas-Hold-Em. I appreciate there’s no time log for a Repl link as there is for a Turnitin submission, but opening the .py file attached in this zip will show that the script is exactly the same.
